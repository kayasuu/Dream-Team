# bucket-list-app

Hello Galit and James ya slacker (ha jokes)

What Su and I previously talked about in the break was about our project and what we wanted to do.

I can't rememeber what the initial idea was as I couldn't remember what was in the slack chat or poll.

# What the project is?

The project proposed now is a bucket list / calendar / bucket list idea with chatGPT / AI API integration.

Su suggested using ChatGPT to receive an itinerary about a place and to plan out a holiday for the user.

The user then can save this itinerary to the database that can be open for other users to see and save and possibly share with other users? Users maybe can search through our database for #hastags from the itinerarys so they don't have to use ChatGPT themselves? Not sure how this functionality will work but if it's similar to project 2 I can do this maybe. 

I suggested that maybe we can extract information from the itinerary received ChatGPT and then add it into a calendar view - or maybe can we export that into a json / API for another calendar app for iOS or Google Calendar? Next levellllllllll.

Also extrapolating from this maybe we can take key moments from the itinerary so that it can be added to a users bucket list?

See how we go team!

To summarise - MVP?

ChatGPT API to return a itinerary that can be stored and saved in our database
Extract dates or events for bucket list item for each user
Extract dates or ideas to maybe define it into a calendar app API or display on our website in a calendar / week format
Share itinerary to other users so it can go on to their calendar?

Extras -
Search feature with #hashtags so users can find all different types of itineraries.

# Did we give ourselves too much work?!
Probably

# Are we going to get it done?!
Hopefully

# Is it going to be useful?!
Most definitely!
