# BUCKETLIST.AI
## By the dream team:
### Su Kayali, Robert Lam, James Preston & Galit Moss

The app in this repo is deployed at [https://express.onrender.com](https://express.onrender.com).
## What the project is?

An app where bucket list travel and AI integration meet in the most uncomplicated way. 

A user can login and pick destinations, choose from a list of potential activities, select a budget level & choose their amount of days. Thanks to Su and our combined love of ChatGPT, whatever the user selects there will be sent to ChatGPT and an itinerary will appear beautifully assembled on the page.

There's also a place for reflections, where you can think about why you picked the destination and what you might want to do there.

Not sure where you want to go? Well Rob's idea for an Explore page will come in handy! Look through every users destination and relevant itineraries for some inspo.

Using AI technology can be really confusing to some, and hopefully with the ease of Bucket List, it'll make the process more exciting for potential users.

## Reflections from each of us:

### Galit:
I really loved playing more with Bootstrap & CSS. Our app could definitely look better, but it's such an improvement for what it could've been. Working in a group was challenging at first with GitHub, trying to juggle how we pushed our changes to try make sure we weren't overlapping was confusing at first. Thankfully I reckon we're all GitHub pros now! And the dream team put all our heads together to produce this, and it's amazing how far we all came. I also appreciated having support from everyone along the way which you don't get in individual projects.

## What does our App look like? Here's a few different examples!

## Did we give ourselves too much work?!
Probably

## Are we going to get it done?!
Hopefully *(turns out, yes)*

## Is it going to be useful?!
Most definitely!

## Take aways from this project
Render sucks. Making a lot of little mistakes really helps you learn.

## Future Features:
Using Stripe API to make users pay so we can generate AI images. If they want more than 5 bucket list items it'll incur a fee.
