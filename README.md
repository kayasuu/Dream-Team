# BUCKETLIST
## By the dream team:
### Su Kayali, Robert Lam, James Preston & Galit Moss

The app in this repo is deployed at [https://express.onrender.com](https://express.onrender.com).
## What the project is?

An app where bucket list travel and AI integration meet in the most uncomplicated way. 

A user can login and pick destinations, choose from a list of potential activities, select a budget level & choose their amount of days. Thanks to Su and our combined love of ChatGPT, whatever the user selects there will be sent to ChatGPT and an itinerary will appear beautifully assembled on the page.

Using AI technology can be really confusing to some, and hopefully with how our app displays and saves info, it'll make the process more exciting for potential users.

## Reflections from each of us:
### Su:

### James:

### Galit:

## Did we give ourselves too much work?!
Probably

## Are we going to get it done?!
Hopefully *(turns out, yes)*

## Is it going to be useful?!
Most definitely!

## Future Features:
Using Stripe API to make users pay so we can generate AI images. If they want more than 5 bucket list items it'll incur a fee.
